            <summary>
            Plays a video in the console using shit I don't understand quite well.
            It's a lot of operations with bytes and pointers to make it faster (~12 FPS).
            I highly recommend downscaling videos to 12 FPS and letting it play at original FPS.
            WARNING: This command can be used only ONCE in a single application run due to internal architecture of consoles.
            It does some weirdy stuff with the way console renders text, and you can't reenter the state again.

            <param name="fps">FPS you wish the video to play at. Set to -1 for automatic FPS recognition (original from the file).
            Disclaimer: This changes how many frames are attempted to be rendered per second, not how many actually are. Make it bigger than original FPS, speed up video. Make it smaller than original FPS, slow down video. The console can't achieve rendering speeds above 12 FPS.</param>
